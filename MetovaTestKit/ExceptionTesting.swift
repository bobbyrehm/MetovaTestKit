 Synchronously tests the provided block for exceptions.  If it would throw an exception, it catches the exception and returns it.

 - returns: The caught exception.  If no exception was thrown, returns `nil`.
 
 - warning: You should not rely on `XCTestExpectation` fulfillment in this block.  If an exception is thrown before fulfillment, the expectation will never be fulfilled.  `XCTestExpectation` should be unnecessary as the block is executed synchronously.
